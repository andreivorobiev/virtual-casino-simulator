# Virtual Casino Simulator

Packaged application release: `0.9.5.73`

Historical source baseline: `9.1.0`

Local play-token browser casino simulator with a descriptor-driven catalog of isolated games (Roulette, Slots, Blackjack, Baccarat, Keno, American Bingo and many more; the canonical catalog is discovered from the `modules/*.json` descriptors), isolated game state, ledger-backed wallet accounting, authenticated private-beta users, Admin telemetry, and optional JSON or MySQL persistence.

## Design decisions

- **Descriptor-driven game catalog.** Each game owns a `modules/<id>.json` descriptor for its identifier, routes, backend callable, and frontend module. Runtime catalog consumers discover the game set from those descriptors instead of maintaining a separate hardcoded list.
- **Game isolation enforced by CI.** `scripts/validate_module_boundaries.py` scans Python and JavaScript imports and rejects cross-game dependencies rather than relying on review alone.
- **Shared exactly-once settlement path.** Games built on `casino/core/simple_game.py` commit round entropy with the ledger transaction, so an exact retry replays the recorded outcome instead of redrawing it.
- **Server-authoritative game intent.** Routed game actions pass through `sanitize_game_intent()`, which strips client-authored outcome fields, while the generated `server-authority-matrix.json` records and validates each module's boundary.
- **Compliance as a build gate.** `scripts/validate_token_terminology.py` runs in CI and rejects real-money wording in active user-facing copy across English and Russian resources.
- **Separated author and integration duties.** Contributor branches carry authored changes, while an independent controller review and merge path is recorded in `docs/claude_codex_work_division.md`.

## Version sources

`modules/module-manifest.json` is the canonical aggregate version source:

- Top-level `application` is the packaged application release shown by runtime, API, browser, and Admin surfaces. It changes only with a formal application release artifact.
- Entries under `modules` are independent source-module revisions. They must be bumped when their owned source changes and may advance without changing the packaged application release.
- `modules.application` is the application module revision, not the packaged application release.
- Top-level `source_baseline` is historical source provenance and is not a current release number.

Runtime version metadata is loaded by `casino/module_versions.py`; `scripts/validate_versions.py` rejects drift between the aggregate manifest, module manifests, runtime values, package metadata, README, and starter documentation.

## Legal and play-token status

The repository source code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

The running app is a private beta toy simulator for local play-token use. It is not a gambling site, not real-money play, and not a payment or cash-out product. Play tokens, balances, chips, tickets, cards, spins, winnings, payouts, jackpots, and ledger entries have no cash value and cannot be redeemed, sold, traded, transferred, exchanged, withdrawn, or converted into money, prizes, goods, services, credits, cryptoassets, or anything else of value.

Private beta end-user terms and privacy expectations are documented in `docs/legal/terms.md` and `docs/legal/privacy.md`.

## Brand and marketing customization

Marketing and public brand surfaces are separated from the reusable simulator core. Start with `docs/marketing_customization.md` before renaming the app, replacing icons, adding a landing site, changing public domains, or preparing a downstream fork.
